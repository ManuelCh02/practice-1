I've been looking to make a transition and ahve headr some people who had an amaxing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I´ve succesfully swithed careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "</p>

                <p class="container__kira-testimonial--second-text">" Before joining the bootcamo, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disppoint. They wer very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was oustanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "</p>
